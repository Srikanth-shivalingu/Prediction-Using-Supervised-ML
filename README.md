# Prediction Using Supervised ML

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of supervised machine learning to predict outcomes using regression analysis. The notebook `Task_1.ipynb` contains step-by-step instructions and code for building a linear regression model to predict data values.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to provide a hands-on introduction to supervised learning, focusing on predicting a dependent variable from a given dataset. In this example, linear regression is employed to showcase how we can build and evaluate predictive models using Python libraries.

### Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, feature selection, and scaling.
- Model Building: Using **Linear Regression** for prediction.
- Model Evaluation: Performance metrics such as R-squared and mean squared error are computed to assess the model's effectiveness.

## Files in the Repository

- **Task_1.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing all steps of the machine learning pipeline, including:
  - Importing and understanding the dataset.
  - Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.
  - Training a linear regression model on the training data.
  - Predicting values using the test set.
  - Evaluating the performance of the model.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for data processing and machine learning.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive coding and visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: A powerful library for machine learning in Python, used to build the regression model.
- **pandas & numpy**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Libraries for data visualization.

## Getting Started

To run the notebook locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srikanth-shivalingu/Prediction-Using-Supervised-ML.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Prediction-Using-Supervised-ML
   ```
3. Install the necessary Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Make sure to create and activate a virtual environment, if needed.)
   
4. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
5. Open the file `Task_1.ipynb` and run the cells sequentially.

## Results

After completing the analysis in the notebook, you will see predictions made by the linear regression model. The model's performance is evaluated using various statistical measures to ensure accuracy.
